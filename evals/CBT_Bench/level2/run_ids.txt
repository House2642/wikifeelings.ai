Except the letter i should be expressed as uppercase. I not i \n- If no beliefs apply, return an empty array [].  \n- Do not invent new categories or fine-grained beliefs. Stick to the list provided.  \n- Be conservative but precise — assign beliefs only if they clearly fit the definition.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFew-Shot Examples\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExample 1:  \nInput:\n{\n  "ori_text": "I have a great boyfriend of 2 years yet I fear something is wrong with me…I developed a crush on someone at work and think about this person a lot...",\n  "situation": "I can’t figure out why I can’t just be satisfied like a normal person.",\n  "thoughts": "- Something is wrong with me. - I will never be satisfied. - I have issues. - I should be able to settle down. - I am a horrible person. - If I lose what I have with my boyfriend, then I will end up alone. - I will never be happy."\n}\n\nOutput:\n[\n  "i am defective",\n  "i am bound to be alone",\n  "i am bad – dangerous, toxic, evil"\n]\n\n---\n\nExample 2:  \nInput:\n{\n  "ori_text": "Everything just seems to be slipping out of my grasp lately. I love my girlfriend with all of my heart and our relationship’s on the rocks...",\n  "situation": "It’s all my fault most likely all i do is constantly worry about everything.",\n  "thoughts": "I should be able to control others around, and when I cant, I cope with it by worrying. There is something wrong with me that I can\'t control others. I am doing everything wrong."\n}\n\nOutput:\n[\n  "i am out of control",\n  "i am defective"\n]\n\n---\n\nExample 3:  \nInput:\n{\n  "ori_text": "A little history lesson… I was 14 years old when I moved out of my mothers house and was told not to come back...",\n  "situation": "My father was shot in the head, my little brother died recently, my mother and I have never had a relationship.",\n  "thoughts": "- Nobody really loves me. - I am all alone in this world. - I am a good person, so why do terrible things happen to me? - Only bad things are bound to happen to me. - Everyone I love dies."\n}\n\nOutput:\n[\n  "i am bound to be alone",\n  "i am bound to be rejected",\n  "i am a victim"\n]\n                  ', role='developer', type='message'), DataSourceResponsesInputMessagesTemplateTemplateEvalItem(content='The thoughts the client are having are: {{ item.thoughts }}', role='user', type='message')], type='template'), model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', sampling_params=None), error=None, eval_id='eval_68d99dbe17e48191ac51902a80e028a7', metadata={}, model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', name='cognitive distortions', object='eval.run', per_model_usage=None, per_testing_criteria_results=None, report_url='https://platform.openai.com/evaluations/eval_68d99dbe17e48191ac51902a80e028a7?project_id=proj_xtDArXBjo9ymRBMaLsfzWNUI&run_id=evalrun_68d9a2c232808191828fb30ab7f55375', result_counts=ResultCounts(errored=0, failed=0, passed=0, total=0), status='queued', shared_with_openai=False)
