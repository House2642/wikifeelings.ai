All-or-nothing thinking (65)\n   - Also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking.\n   - You view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum.\n\n2. Mind reading (47)\n   - You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities.\n\n3. Fortune-telling (44)\n   - You predict the future negatively without considering other, more likely outcomes.\n\n4. Personalization (42)\n   - You believe others are behaving negatively because of you, without considering more plausible explanations.\n\n5. Emotional reasoning (36)\n   - You think something must be true because you “feel” it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary.\n\n6. Overgeneralization (32)\n   - You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation.\n\n7. Labeling (29)\n   - You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less extreme conclusion.\n\n8. Should statements \n   - Also called imperatives. You have a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave, and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met.\n\n9. Magnification\n   - You unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive when evaluating yourself, another person, or a situation.\n\n10. Mental filter\n    - Also called selective abstraction. You pay undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nInstructions\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Output should be a JSON array of distortion labels.\n- Each array element must be one of the distortions listed above (verbatim).\n- Multiple distortions may apply to a single thought.\n- If no distortions apply, return an empty array [].\n- Do not invent new categories. Stick to the list provided.\n- Be conservative but precise — assign distortions only if they clearly fit the definition.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFew-Shot Examples\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n{\n  "ori_text": "First off I would like to thank you for taking the time out to help me. But the problem is I’m depressed but nobody knows it. Half the reason I am is because I have no really close friends to hang out with...",\n  "situation": "I’m depressed but nobody knows it. I do not have any friends. This started at age 11.",\n  "thoughts": "I cannot make friends and have no one to hang out with. Therefore, I am always going to be alone and depressed."\n}\n\nOutput:\n[\n  "mental filter"\n]\n\n---\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n{\n  "ori_text": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 years. With being sexually active with each other for 3 years prior. Before we started dating and for the first year of our relationship her sex drive was amazing. Over time it slowly decreased...",\n  "situation": "I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years and we have a history of a strong sexual intimacy connection. This has been getting worse over time.",\n  "thoughts": "It is my girlfriend\'s sex drive that is the problem."\n}\n\nOutput:\n[\n  "overgeneralization",\n  "labeling"\n]\n\n---\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n{\n  "ori_text": "I started going to therapy in December, after 3 other failed attempts. I’ve been consistent in going, and have really developed a rapport with my therapist. In my past, I have not been forthcoming with my feelings. I tend to hide, makeup stories of trauma to help cope with things that have happened...",\n  "situation": "In my past, I have not been forthcoming with my feelings. I tend to hide, makeup stories of trauma to help cope with things that have happened. I was violently raped in college, and never told anyone about it.",\n  "thoughts": "I was raped, so I don’t know if I can trust anyone again. If I do and something horrible happens, I don’t know if I could go on. I feel ugly, like everything is wrong with me. I’ve been hiding who I am because that trauma is the ugliest part of me. If I tell anyone what happened, they will judge me and reject me – and then I’ll be alone. So, I kept this ugly secret about myself and pretended everything was okay."\n}\n\nOutput:\n[\n  "labeling",\n  "magnification",\n  "fortune-telling"\n] ', role='developer', type='message'), DataSourceResponsesInputMessagesTemplateTemplateEvalItem(content='The thoughts the client are having are: {{ item.thoughts }}', role='user', type='message')], type='template'), model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', sampling_params=None), error=None, eval_id='eval_68d2fa38ed6c8191abadb896f9d861bf', metadata={}, model='gpt-5-2025-08-07', name='cognitive distortions', object='eval.run', per_model_usage=None, per_testing_criteria_results=None, report_url='https://platform.openai.com/evaluations/eval_68d2fa38ed6c8191abadb896f9d861bf?project_id=proj_xtDArXBjo9ymRBMaLsfzWNUI&run_id=evalrun_68d303ec37f08191afce38b2064f672c', result_counts=ResultCounts(errored=0, failed=0, passed=0, total=0), status='queued', shared_with_openai=False)
