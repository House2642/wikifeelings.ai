        "response": "No pardon needed. I truly see where you\u2019re coming from. The idea that thinking in\nextremes might contribute to your concerns doesn\u2019t really fit your experience. It makes\nsense, then, that the homework was off base. I wonder how it feels for me to have\nassigned it?"
