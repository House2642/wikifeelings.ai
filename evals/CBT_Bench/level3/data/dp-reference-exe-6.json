        "response": "Yes, that reduction in tension or anxiety can feel like a relief and feel good in the moment.\nCanceling a plan like that is a pretty effective way of reducing anxiety. Keeping this in mind,\nwe should discuss a process that is called negative reinforcement, and how it can help us\nunderstand how anxiety is maintained or even strengthened over time. Let\u2019s think through\nwhat we learn from this."

When we\u2019ve discussed your alcohol use,\nit seems like there are some specific circumstances that are associated with your drinking.\nAlthough we don\u2019t want to cut you off from your friends or any place that might serve\nalcohol forever, there are situations that are going to be more or less helpful to you.\nI\u2019m interested in hearing more about your concerns, and I suggest that we brainstorm\na plan.

        "response": "Yes, and that might sound counterintuitive. It\u2019s important for the bed and bedroom to be\nspecifically associated with sleep. The reality is that you aren\u2019t sleeping anyway. When you\nleave the bedroom and come back when you are ready for sleep, you train your brain to\nlearn that the bed is the place for sleep."

It\u2019s possible this expectation makes it hard to take the first\nstep toward finding new, meaningful activities.

        "response": "I hear you. Recall that there are two parts to this work\u2014the actual exposure and then\npreventing the behaviors that you typically engage in to respond to the perceived threat\nof the germs. We need to fully disrupt this process of negative reinforcement if you are\ngoing to overcome this problem; in other words, refraining from washing is also critical."

        "response": "I would like to understand better. It can be hard to imagine doing things when feeling so\ndepressed, and that just further highlights the difficulty of what we\u2019re up against. We can\ndevelop concrete strategies to help you take the initial step."

I don\u2019t want to\ninvalidate your frustration because it is real, yet I also see you getting on a train in the\nfirst place as significant progress. However, I would like to know more details about what\nhappened, and I also think it would be important to revisit the goals of exposure.
