This is a well-researched\napproach with substantial support for its effectiveness across a broad range of clients and\nproblems. Of course, each person is unique and experiences things differently. So, we\u2019ll\ntailor what we do to best fit your needs and preferences, and make sure that we prioritize\nchecking in to see what seems to be working or not working for you."

        "response": "That\u2019s a great question! In cognitive behavioral therapy, we\u2019ll be looking at your\ncognitions\u2014that is, your thoughts and your behaviors\u2014to identify whether I can teach you\nsome skills for managing them that will help you address some of the problems you are\nwanting help with. Does that help answer your question?"

        "response": "We\u2019ll likely talk about a variety of things. Ultimately, we want to focus on what\u2019s most\nimportant to you. We\u2019ll set goals for treatment; I\u2019ll teach you skills for noticing and\nmodifying thoughts and behaviors; you\u2019ll do homework to practice; we\u2019ll set an agenda\nat the beginning of each session and take up concrete, specific things you want help\nwith; and we\u2019ll monitor progress as we proceed, making adjustments if we do not get the\nprogress we want."

        "response": "I can appreciate that therapy may be a bit of a mystery to you. I am interested in your\nhistory. In general, CBT emphasizes current and future experiences, though we may need\nto discuss your past experiences to help us contextualize the present."

In general,\nbefore we send you out the door with an assignment, we\u2019ll spend some time thinking\nabout what might make it hard for you to do and figure out a strategy or two to help with\nthat.

I can say it\u2019s pretty common for people to be uncertain about whether\ntherapy is the right option for them, whether therapy in general or of a particular type.\nBased on what I\u2019ve heard thus far, I believe that therapy could help you, but I want to help\nyou make an informed choice that is going to best meet your needs at this time."

It seems like it would be good for\nus to lay out or talk about a range of types of therapies so you can make a decision about\nwhich might be the best fit.

        "response": "Given your bad experiences, I can see why you might be skeptical. Frankly, I think every\ncourse of therapy is different, and there\u2019s a lot of potential for this to be different for you.\nI think it would be important to discuss your previous experiences with therapy, in\nparticular what was unhelpful, and what, if anything, was at least somewhat helpful.

        "response": "That\u2019s an important question that\u2019s somewhat difficult to answer. I realize this might be\nfrustrating to hear, but it depends. This approach to therapy is generally built on a shorter\nterm model that has a track record of effectiveness, but each person is unique. We\u2019ll be\nmonitoring progress at every session and would expect to see improvement by six or eight\nsessions. If we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll want to discuss whether any changes are needed."

        "response": "I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019ve had negative experiences. That sounds really difficult, and I\nthink it\u2019s understandable for you to ask that question. First, I think it\u2019s important to be clear\nthat you\u2019ll never be \u201cforced\u201d to do anything in our work together. Without necessarily\ngoing into the content of your past traumatic experiences, it would be helpful to hear a\nbit more about the nature of the work that you were doing with your previous therapist\nand the circumstances around your hospitalization.

        "response": "This is an important point of clarification. I actually agree that the past is important, and\npast experience is still relevant to this approach. Although we tend to focus on the present\nand what is going on now, your past is by no means \u201coff limits.\u201d In fact, we will probably\nneed to discuss your past experiences to better understand your present life. If and when\nthat seems most relevant, we will go there, while making sure that we connect things to\nwhat is most helpful for you now. Does that seem like a good fit for your interests?"
