Now that we\u2019ve spent some time on this together, what do you think about\npracticing this a bit more on your own, between now and our next session? As we\u2019ve\ndiscussed, this is common practice in CBT, and people often find it very useful, even if\nsometimes challenging. Shall we come up with a plan for that?"

Here\u2019s an idea: If I give you a\nthought record, would you be able to focus on an upsetting situation and write down the\nemotions and thoughts you have in that situation, just like we\u2019ve done in here together?"

If it works for you, I suggest we spend our remaining minutes thinking\nabout and planning for the next week. Let\u2019s find something on your hierarchy that you can\naim for between today and our next session. It can be useful to have a few related options\nthat slightly vary in expected difficulty.

If\nthis was a \u201cslam dunk,\u201d we probably wouldn\u2019t spend too much of your time on it. On the\none hand, we want to push beyond your comfort zone a bit, but on the other hand, we\nalso don\u2019t want to blow right past it if that isn\u2019t going to be helpful.

Regarding doing all of the homework correctly, although we want to be on the same\npage, honest mistakes invariably create useful learning opportunities. It might sound weird,\nbut part of me actually wants you to make some mistakes because we often learn best\nfrom them."

For now, I\nwould suggest either continuing to reflect on what we discussed today or repeating the\nwork that you did for today\u2019s session. Repetition is a good thing. It\u2019s up to you\u2014one or\nboth of these would work. How does that sound?"

There\nmay be different versions of this that could be more or less helpful at this time.

What about brainstorming what part or parts of this might be\nmore feasible over the next week? I would suggest that we not abandon this completely\nbecause doing at least some homework has been shown to relate to improvement. But you\ncan only do what you can fit in.

It\u2019s important to be on the\nsame page, and I certainly could have been clearer. Let\u2019s walk back a bit rather than rush\nahead prematurely."

Let\u2019s go into the details of the\nassignment to see how we can set something up that is more doable for you. It\u2019s also\nimportant to emphasize that this isn\u2019t something that you\u2019re either going to \u201cpass\u201d or \u201cfail.\u201d\nThe process is just as, or even more, important than the outcome."

Rather than\nlabeling what happened as \u201cOK\u201d or \u201cnot OK,\u201d I\u2019d rather discuss your experience of\ncompleting the homework and how drinking beforehand does or does not fit in with the\nspirit of the work you\u2019re during between our sessions.

        "response": "I\u2019m glad to hear how much you\u2019re invested in this work and that you can find ways to stay\nmotivated to continue the work between sessions, which can be difficult.
