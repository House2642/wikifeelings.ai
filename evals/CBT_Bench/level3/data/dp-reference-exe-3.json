We might also\nstart by reviewing the homework, seeing if that suggests any other agenda items. How\ndoes that sound?"

I was thinking that we would begin by\nreviewing your experience with the homework over the past week, including any questions\nthat came up for you. That should then be a nice segue to something I\u2019d like to introduce\nand practice a bit in here today. We can spend most of the session on that and then save\nsome time to make a plan for the next week. Of course, I also want to make sure that we\nbudget time for anything else that you\u2019d like to discuss today. Is there anything you\u2019d like\nto add?"

We can\nspend a few minutes reviewing what you\u2019ve worked on since the last session, and then we\ncan discuss what is going to be most helpful between today and our next appointment\u2014\nfor example, continuing on with a similar plan or making some adjustments."

Regardless, I want to make sure that we focus on the things that\nare most important to you. In my experience, it can be helpful to do this in the context of\na general plan connected to your goals to keep things on track and continue to move our\nwork forward.

        "response": "So, here\u2019s my thought. My experience is that exposure can be scary and challenging, and\nI\u2019ve found if we get started on the road of putting it off because something else came\nup, then it becomes easier and easier to keep putting off. Then we find ourselves off our\nagreed-on path. So, my suggestion would be let\u2019s do some exposure first and aim to save\nsome time for the other topic. Does that plan work for you?"

        "response": "I see. You\u2019re bringing up an important point. I agree that it\u2019s important to also focus on\nstrengths and be mindful of and build on what is positive, so this is helpful feedback. I also\nwonder about your perspective on this.

        "response": "Sure, we can add this discussion to the agenda today. Thanks, for sharing this with me;\nI\u2019m not familiar with this technique and would need a bit more time to understand it. First,\nthough, I\u2019m curious about what\u2019s drawn you to it. The possibility of feeling better faster\nseems generally appealing. I wonder if you have concerns about our pace in here because\nthat seems like an important piece of this discussion. Would you prefer to begin there or\ncome back to this?"
