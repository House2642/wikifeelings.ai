        "response": "Being happier sounds like a reasonable goal to me. I wonder, though, if we can break it\ndown a bit into something more concrete. For example, what would it look like to be\nhappier? How, precisely, might your life be different?"

        "response": "I can appreciate that. Perhaps we can start by narrowing the focus a bit. How will we know\nif you\u2019re happier, say, one month from now? What would be a good indication of that?"

        "response": "I know it\u2019s exhausting, and no one can blame you for having that goal. In cases like yours,\nwe want to get the anxiety to more manageable levels. Is it more accurate to say that\nyou have a goal of reducing anxiety? Or do you want to eliminate it altogether\u2014never\nfeel anxious?"

        "response": "That\u2019s an important question, and the answer is, it depends, in part based on your goals and\npreferences. I can say that this therapy will not be indefinite because we\u2019ll work to give you\nthe skills to become your own therapist and carry forward the work independently. Tell me\nmore about your question. Are you worried about being here forever?"

        "response": "I suppose in some ways I\u2019m an expert, but I want to avoid unilaterally dictating your goals\nand how we go about achieving them. Further, you\u2019re the expert on you, including what\nyou need and your preferences for our work together. I have some ideas about this but\nthink it would be best to discuss and plan together.

In fact, we\u2019ll work together today\nto develop a general road map for your therapy, while collaboratively establishing an\nagenda each session. We might find that some recurring themes emerge and drive our\nwork (more so than just what comes to mind). Does that make sense?"

        "response": "As we\u2019ve discussed, the CBT approach tends to emphasize learning by doing\u2014in particular,\ntrying things out in between sessions, in your daily life. Although each person is different,\nit can be difficult to translate or generalize the work we do in here to your day-to-day life\nwithout trying out new things and applying them outside of here. Now, that can look a\nlot of different ways, depending on your preferences and the given week. Perhaps we can\ndiscuss some of your concerns and expectations regarding homework?"

        "response": "I can see how it\u2019s hard to picture how things might be different, and at this point, there\nmight be a part of you that\u2019s overwhelmed by the work that\u2019s ahead. And there is another\npart that brought you here today, and that reality is not trivial and gives me hope for you.\nPerhaps this feeling of hopelessness is itself a problem worth working on (i.e., to reduce or\novercome) as a goal in here. Do you have thoughts on that?"

        "response": "I\u2019d like to hear more details about that. If relationship issues are most concerning to you,\nwe can focus our work on that area. In our individual work together, we\u2019ll need to focus on\nthings that you can change. Part of our session today can be brainstorming what some of\nthose things might be."

        "response": "Some people with similar problems do benefit from medication, or a combination of CBT\nand medication. Although biology is important, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d frame this as a problem\nwith your brain. Even if we did stipulate this, CBT can also change your brain.

        "response": "That\u2019s important to know. The evidence seems to show that more consistent, weekly\nsessions is best, on average. Can we discuss your concerns in more detail and brainstorm a\nplan to support your ability to make it to sessions, as well as how we\u2019ll communicate about\nthis as things come up?"

        "response": "OK, so if I\u2019m understanding you, you\u2019re suggesting that I\u2019m asking to set goals for reasons\nother than that they\u2019ll be helpful to you. Is that right? It seems like you\u2019re concerned about\nme being really committed to you. You deserve to feel confident your therapist is really\nconcerned about you, not just getting paid, so let\u2019s put this on the agenda and talk about\nit. Would that be OK?"

        "response": "That\u2019s important to hear, and I can see how that might make it hard to come up with goals!\nJust to clarify, is the uncertainty about therapy in general or the CBT model that we\u2019ve\nstarted to introduce? It might seem a bit backward, but identifying potential goals can also\ninform what we do in here."
